# 🏡 Real Estate Property Search (RAG)

An intelligent real estate search application powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** that understands natural language queries and delivers context-aware property recommendations. Instead of relying on traditional keyword matching, this system uses semantic embeddings and vector similarity to identify the most relevant properties.

Designed as a scalable academic AI project, the application combines machine learning, efficient retrieval, and an interactive UI to simulate a modern property recommendation platform.

## 📌 Features

✅ **Semantic Property Search**  
Understands user intent using sentence-transformer embeddings rather than keyword-based filtering.

✅ **FAISS Vector Database**  
Enables lightning-fast similarity search across indexed properties.

✅ **Hybrid Search**  
Combines metadata filtering (price, bedrooms) with vector retrieval for improved accuracy.

✅ **AI-Based Recommendations**  
Retrieves the most relevant properties and ranks them based on semantic closeness.

✅ **Market Analytics Dashboard**  
Visualizes average property prices by city to help users make data-driven decisions.

✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI**  
Clean, responsive interface with filters, search suggestions, and dynamic results.

✅ **Scalable Architecture**  
Designed to support larger datasets and production-style retrieval pipelines.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture that enhances language models by retrieving relevant external data before generating responses.

### Pipeline:
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Retrieve Matches → Generate Insight


This approach:

- Reduces hallucinations  
- Improves factual accuracy  
- Keeps token usage efficient  
- Enables context-aware recommendations
